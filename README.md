# CUDA Hashing Algorithms Collection
#### Author: Matt Zweil & The Mochimo Core Contributor Team

This repository of CUDA Hash functions is released into the Public Domain.

To use any of the associated hashing functions, please include the config.h header file.

Alternatively, you can just define these three definitions yourself, and omit the config.h file:

```
typedef unsigned char BYTE;
typedef unsigned int  WORD;
typedef unsigned long long LONG;
```

Special thanks to Brad Conte for his original public domain C implementations of some of these algos.
